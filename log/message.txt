ran this site hosted by netlify, autodeploy using github, it's free.
                
i was inspired by how from software game deliver it story-telling by adding clue at every part of the game like item description, dialogue, etc, kek, mereka ngasih story-telling yang ngga explicit, kita yang harus figure it out sendiri gimana ceritanya
                
heavily inspired from vngnc/izzy, frkn awesome
